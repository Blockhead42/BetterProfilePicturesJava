      <h3>Why do you make all these images?</h3>
      <p>We just like to. We like logos and enjoy sharing our love with other people. We also hate seeing people without a custom profile picture and hopefully this website can help remedy that issue.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>How do you make all these logos?</h3>
      <p>Most of them are just a matter of copy pasting an image of the logo into Adobe Illustrator and tracing it into a vector format so that we can put it on the backgrounds that we've also made in Illustrator in the colors that we want so that it matches all our other logos. But that only works for logos that already exist in the world like video game or superhero logos, every single logo found in Abstract, Animals, Food, Holidays, Objects, Other, Sports, and Symbols pages were handmade by us. Most of those logos are pretty easy logos that you could find just about anywhere though, so don't be too impressed.</p>

      <h3>Who are you?</h3>
      <p>"We" are actually just me, there's currently only one person on the team that made this website, Nathanael Jacobsma, and I go by the username of Blockhead. I have worked to make all of the images, the website flow and layout, absolutely eveything was done by me so far. I do however use my friends for suggestions on what logos I should add, since my knowledge of the world doesn't encompass everything.</p>
