# BetterProfilePicutresJava
Automatically generating a new profile picture using a java canvas. 

This is a website that will build you a custom profile picture based on the choices you make to build one.
For example you can select a logo from a game (for example the Assassin's Creed game),
set the color of the logo to red, set the background color to white,
leave the background style as blast, and finally set the shape of the picture to a hexagon.
Just like that you have a custom made profile picture that you can download and use anywhere you'd like.

With all the options on the page there are almost 20 million combinations (of course some combinations aren't great though)
so you can get exactly what you're looking for.

In the future I will add an upload button that will allow you to upload a logo or background of your choosing
for literally infinite possabilities.
